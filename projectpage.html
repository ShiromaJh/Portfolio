        The Movie Fusion webpage is a responsive site that allows you to search
        through movies, TV shows and actors in order to get detailed information
        and find out where they are available to be streamed. It also allows
        users to save their favorite movie or show to a favorites page for
        reference later. The navbar is the same across all the pages allowing
        users to return home to search for additional shows or go to their
        favorites list. On mobile devices, the nav links will reduce down to a
        hamburger menu. The main landing page has a search bar to find your
        desired movie, TV show or actor/actress. The results will display below
        in the form of either a movie/tv poster image with the title or a
        headshot with a name. The shows will also have an option to save
        directly to the favorites which is stored on local storage. There is a
        check on all save to favorites buttons to see if the title is already in
        you favorites list, and if it is, the button changes to a remove from
        favorites. The images and titles/names act as links to other webpages to
        get more information about either the movie/TV show or actor/actress.
        The movie page will display all the associated information about a
        selected movie or TV show and also have a save to favorites button. A
        larger poster image will display as well as the title, the date release
        (in the case of TV shows, the date it ended as well), the length (for TV
        shows, it will show the number of seasons, total number of episodes and
        avg runtime), and a description. Below that it will display what
        streaming options are available to view the show on. It will check
        against Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus and supply
        a link to the applicable site directed to that show. If it is not
        available on any of these services, a link will be provided to TMBD
        which has additional streaming or rental services that it might be
        available on. Below that, it will display the cast of the show using the
        same display function as the search page with links to more information
        about that actor. The actors page will give more detailed information
        about the actor or actress including a larger headshot, their name,
        their birthday, and a bio. Below their information, it will also display
        other movies or TV shows that they are known for. These images will
        allow you to immediately save to local storage or go to the associated
        information page. The favorites page will pull all your saved favorite
        titles from local storage and display their posters and titles with the
        option to remove them from the favorites list. If clicked on, you will
        go to that movie or TV shows information page. To visit this application
